# csv-validator

Tiny project that accepts a CSV, validates columns based on a set of rules and spits out an import example.

## run it

just open the [index.html](index.html) and you should be good to go.

## live reload

To debug the html contents, it's easiest to use the `livereload` plugin. The snippet is automatically added to the layout header unless running in `production` environment.

```
npm install -g livereload
livereload
```
